# main goal
A way to define periodic budgets to help the user to organize, be smart and antecipate their spendings. Analysis of with what and where the money is going. A way to share the goals and spending with partner, family or friends. When reviewing spendings, the user is able to see who's speding more and where (using tags).
The app tracks speding and splits in two ways: by user and by tag. Later we can analyze who spent and in what way.

## tags
The app is tag centric. Every transaction and budget are linked to one or more tags. A transaction can be splited between tags.

## speding tracking
The user must be able to add her transactions in the app and link to tags and spenders so she can track her budgets

## spending update
After a transction is added, the budgets are updated and the user can review the new numbers

## budget overlimit
The user is able to choose the behaviour of budget overlimit:
    - shrink other budgets to stay on monthly budget sum
    - budget warning (just visual feedback)

### spender
The person who spend the money

### split
The user must be able to split a transaction between spenders or between tags

### transaction
A transaction represents a real world transfer between person and business or person to person
